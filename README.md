# Linked-List-Task-Planner
This C project is a task planner that lets users manage a to-do list. Users can add tasks with descriptions, priorities, and due dates. Tasks are stored in a linked list and automatically sorted by due date and priority. Users can display tasks, mark tasks as done (moving them to the end), delete tasks, and exit the program.
